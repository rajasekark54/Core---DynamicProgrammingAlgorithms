Write a function `canConstruct(target, wordBank)` that accepts  a targetSum and an array of strings.

The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not the `target` can be constructed by concatenating elements of the `wordBank` array.

You may reuse elements of `wordBank` as many times as needed. 



conConstruct(abcdef, [ab, abc, cd, def, abcd]) -> true

                                                  Abc + def

canCanstruct('skateboard', ['bo', 'rd', 'ate', 't', 'ska', 'sk', 'boar']) --> false

                                                  ska + t + ?
                                                  sk + ate + boar + ?
                                                  sk + ate + bo + ?
