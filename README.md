# Core Dynamic Programming

This repository contains solutions to various dynamic programming problems implemented in JavaScript.

I created this repository for personal reference, and I hope it also serves as a helpful resource for others who want to understand Big O and experiment with different complexities.

## Problem Descriptions

- **0_Recursive**: Contains solutions using basic recursive techniques.
- **1_Fib**: Implements various approaches to solving the Fibonacci sequence problem, including recursive, memoization, and tabulation methods.
- **2_GridTraveller**: Provides solutions for the Grid Traveller problem using recursion, memoization, and tabulation.
- **3_canSum**: Solutions for the canSum problem utilizing recursion, memoization, and tabulation.
- **4_HowSum**: Implementations for the HowSum problem using recursion and memoization.
- **5_BestSum**: Solutions for the BestSum problem using recursion and memoization.
- **6_canConstruct**: Contains solutions for the canConstruct problem using recursion and memoization.
- **7_countConstruct**: Provides solutions for the countConstruct problem using recursion and memoization.
- **8_allConstruct**: Solutions for the allConstruct problem using recursion and memoization.

Each problem directory contains JavaScript files implementing different dynamic programming techniques along with a `question.txt` file providing details of the problem statement.

## Usage

You can explore each problem folder to find JavaScript files containing solutions. Each solution file is named according to the technique used. For example, `1_RecursiveTechnic.js` indicates a solution using recursion.

Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to this repository to improve the implementations or add new problems.
