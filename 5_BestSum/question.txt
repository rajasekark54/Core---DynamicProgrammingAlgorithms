Write a function `bestSum(target, numbers)` that takes in a targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments.

The function should return an array containing the shortest combination of numbers that add up to exactly the targetSum.

If there is tie for the shortest combination, you may return any one of the shortest.

homeSum(7, [5, 3, 4, 7]) -> [3, 4]
                         -> [7] ans


homeSum(8, [2, 3, 5]) -> [2, 2, 2, 2]    
                      -> [2, 3, 3] 
                      -> [3, 5]
